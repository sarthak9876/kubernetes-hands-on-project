# Troubleshooting Guide

This section provides a roadmap for diagnosing and resolving issues in your Kubernetes cluster and applications. Each guide is interlinked for easy navigation.

## üìö Troubleshooting Topics

- [Common Issues](common-issues.md): Pod scheduling, CrashLoopBackOff, PVC issues, and more.
- [Cluster Issues](cluster-issues.md): Node readiness, control plane failures, networking problems.
- [Application Issues](application-issues.md): Service access, health checks, application-specific errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with Common Issues** if you see pods stuck, restarts, or general errors.
2. **Check Cluster Issues** for node/network-wide problems or if the control plane is unresponsive.
3. **Review Application Issues** for problems with deployed services, endpoints, or health checks.

Each topic includes:
- **Symptoms**: What you‚Äôll observe
- **Possible Causes**: What might be wrong
- **How to Fix**: Step-by-step commands and checks
