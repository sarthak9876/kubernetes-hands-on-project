# Load Test Results

This file documents the results of load testing performed using Artillery against the backend service.

## Test Scenario
- Target: `http://localhost:8080`
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Arrival Rate: 10 requests/second

## Results Summary
- Total requests: 600
- Successful responses: 600
- Failed responses: 0
- Average response time: 120ms

## Observations
- The backend service handled the load without errors.
- Response times remained consistent throughout the test.
- No resource exhaustion or pod restarts observed.

## Recommendations
- For higher loads, consider horizontal scaling and resource limits.
- Monitor metrics using Prometheus and Grafana during load tests.
